ldns tutorial


In this tutorial we will explain how to make a simple application with
ldns.

* Introduction

The following paragraphs will introduce some concepts used in ldns. It is 
assumed that the reader is familiar with DNS (knowledge of DNSSEC is not
a problem). 

Take for instance the following RR:
open.nlnetlabs.nl	8600	IN	A 	213.154.224.1

This RR consists out of 4 elements:
1. 'open.nlnetlabs.nl' -  the ownername of the RR
2. '8600'              -  the TTL of the RR
3. 'IN'                -  the class of the RR
4. 'A'                 -  the type of the RR
5. '213.154.224.1'     -  1 rdata field

'213.154.224.1'
To begin with the last element, ldns calls that a RDATA FIELD, or rdf. This
is the smallest type in ldns. An RR's rdata consists of 1 or several rdf's.
All these rdf's have a type, in the case of an A record, this type is
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_A.

The data in a rdf is stored in network byte order.

'A'
This is the type of the whole RR, this type is called LDNS_RR_TYPE_A in
ldns.

'IN'
the class

'8600'
The TTL of a RR, stored in host order 

'open.nlnetlabs.nl'
The ownername of the RR, this owner name is stored in wire data, this this
particaliar name is stored as 04open09nlnetlabs02nl00.

RDF TYPES
The following rdf types exist in ldns:
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_A		- for ip4 addresses
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_AAAA	- for ip6 addresses
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_TXT	- for txt
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_INT8	- for 8 bit numbers
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_INT16	- for 16 bit numbers
LDNS_RDF_TYPE_INT32	- for 32 bit numbers
...
etc.


RR TYPES
ldns knows about the following RR types:
LDNS_RR_TYPE_A
LDNS_RR_TYPE_AAAA
LDNS_RR_TYPE_TXT
LDNS_RR_TYPE_DNSKEY
...
etc.


RR CLASSES
LDNS_RR_CLASS_IN
LDNS_RR_CLASS_HS
LDNS_RR_CLASS_CH
...
etc.

* Making a small application with ldns

In this tutorial we will make a small application which takes a domain name
and looks up the MX records for this domain. We will call this program:
'mx'.

Current TODO list

What actually doesn't work:
---------------------------
o NSEC conversion frm str to host
o Signing
o Different digests for DS
 - need a digest type?
o NSEC generation??
o openssl's setup function (esp. random)
o -lssl in library creation and autoconf
o Documentation (manpages) "const char bvklala() is not parsed correctly)
  const function are correct i think, but const values in struct not

Implementation:
---------------
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o use size_t where needed
o DNSSEC
	- signing
	- do we call random()?
o verify rrsig should work for single keys or return a list of 
  keys that verified (now you don't know which keys are verified in a list)
o NSEC cannot be converted from str to host fmt
o per RR functions (started, see rr_functions.c)
o conversion from  ldns_key to key rr's
o init function? random - load_ssl_errors()
	- SSL_load_error_str()? 
o SERVER stuff; open connection and such

To ponder and discuss:
----------------------
o private key type?
	ldns_algorithm used for verfication
	ldns_sign_algorithm used for signing - including
				shared secret signing

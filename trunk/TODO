Current TODO list

What actually doesn't work:
---------------------------
o NSEC conversion frm str to host
o Signing
o Different digests for DS
 - need a digest type?
o NSEC generation??
o openssl's setup function (esp. random)

Implementation:
---------------
o deep free
o parentheses in parsing is nonsense as we do not keep state
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o use size_t where needed
o DNSSEC
	- signing
	- do we call random()?
o Make a shared library and test compile some programs
o Thread safety, strtok is used...
o NSEC cannot be converted from str to host fmt
o ssl autoconf
o create a bunch of small programs, mx is created, todo: SOA
o resolver_frm_file (better parser)
o Remove all the printf's - and tie them into error handling
o per RR functions (started, see rr_functions.c)
o conversion from  ldns_key to key rr's
o init function? random - load_ssl_errors()
	- SSL_load_error_str()? 

Documentation:
--------------
o Crypto interface for dnssec
o Doxygen
o Manpages - can they be created or not?
o Introduction
o Tutorial
o Webpage
o Mailing list(s)
o Move all the documentation to the header files?
o Check the documentation

To ponder and discuss:
----------------------
o ldns_lookup_by_name works for types, classes
	should be shielded, only use ldns_get_class_by_name/type
o private key type?
	ldns_algorithm used for verfication
	ldns_sign_algorithm used for signing - including
				shared secret signing

Current TODO list

Implementation:
---------------
o Deep clone / deep free
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o network code
	- tsig?
o printing of signatures dates/times
o DNSSEC
	- define algorithms?
	- signing?
o Make a shared library and test compile some programs
o Thread safety
o ssl autoconf


Documentation:
--------------
o Crypto interface for dnssec
o Doxygen
o Manpages
o Introduction
o Tuturial
o Webpage
o Mailing list(s)

To ponder and discuss:
----------------------
o Second layer (higher level convenience functions)? (Later)
  o Higherlevel functions, like search for this RR with this name in
    these RRlists. Give me all RR's of this zone with this type. etc.
o Dependency on openSSL?
o ldns_lookup_by_name works for types, classes
	should be shielded, only use ldns_get_class_by_name/type
o rr_list or rr in dnssec functions or both?

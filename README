* Development 
ldns is mostly developed on Linux and FreeBSD. It is regularly tested to
compile on other systems like Solaris and Mac OS X.

REQUIREMENTS
- OpenSSL (Optional, but needed for features like DNSSEC)
- (GNU) libtool (that's glibtool, not libtool in OSX)
- GNU make

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-<VERSION>
5. ./configure
6. gmake (it needs gnu make to compile, on systems where GNU make is the
   default you can just use 'make')
7. sudo gmake install
8. Optional. (cd examples; ./configure; gmake), make example programs included.
9. Optional. (cd drill; ./configure; gmake; gmake install), to build drill.

You can configure and compile it in a separate build directory.

* Examples
There are some examples in the examples/ directory. These can be built with:
1. cd examples/
2  autoreconf
3. ./configure [--with-ldns=<path to ldns installation or build>]
4. gmake

* Drill
Drill can be built with:
1. cd drill/
2. autoreconf
3. ./configure [--with-ldns=<path to ldns installation or build>]
4. gmake

Note that you need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you want to run the binaries
and you have not installed the library to a system directory. You can use
the make target all-static for the examples to run them if you don't want to
install the library.


* Building from subversion repository

If you are building from the repository you will need to have (gnu)
autotools like libtool and autoreconf installed. A list of all the commands
needed to build everything can be found in README.svn. Note that the actual
commands may be a little bit different on your machine.

* Developers
ldns is developed by the ldns team at NLnet Labs. This team currently
consists of:

  o Miek Gieben
  o Wouter Wijngaards

We have received patches from the following people, thanks!

KNOWN ISSUES

For MACOSX 10.4, it seems that you have to set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
environment variable to 10.4 before running make. Apparently it defaults to
10.1.

This appears to be a known problem in 10.2 to 10.4, see:
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1233.html
for more information.

Also RedHat 9 seems to be having a problem when building ldns - we have
very little details about this.

* Development 
ldns is developed on Linux and FreeBSD.

REQUIREMENTS
- OpenSSL
- (GNU) libtool (that's glibtool, not libtool in OSX)
- GNU make

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-<VERSION>
5. ./configure
6. gmake (it needs gnu make to compile, on systems where GNU make is the
   default you can just use 'make')
7. sudo gmake install
(8. gmake examples [make example programs included])
(9. gmake drill && sudo gmake drill-install to build and install drill)

* Examples
There are some examples in the examples/ directory. These can be built with:
1. make examples 
(in the build directory of the library)

You can also do it yourself:

1. autoreconf
2. ./configure
3. gmake

The library has to be installed in order for this to work. If it is not
installed in one of the default paths (i.e. if you have specified --prefix
when configuring the library) you can use --with-ldns=PATH to specify that
path.

If you have only built the library and not installed it you can add the
directories with the headers and libraries to the search path of configure
by specifying:
LDFLAGS="-L<build-dir>/.libs" CPPFLAGS="-I<build-dir> -I<src_dir>"

In that last case, you will also need to have your LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to
the .libs directory to be able to run the examples.


* Drill

Building drill is the same as building the examples.

If you want to build drill by hand, the configure and running options are
the same as those for the examples. You can use the make target 'lib' if you
only want to build the library and not drill (and make install-lib to
install it).


* Building from repository

If you are building from the repository you will need to have (gnu)
autotools like libtool and autoreconf installed. A list of all the commands
needed to build everything can be found in README.svn. Note that the actual
commands may be a little bit different on your machine. Most important are
libtoolize and make allautoconf (or do autoreconf manually in the subdirs)


* Developers
ldns is developed by the ldns team at NLnet Labs. This team currently
consists out of:
  o Jelte Jansen
  o Erik Rozendaal
  o Miek Gieben

* Credits
We have received patches from the following people, thanks!

KNOWN ISSUES

It has been brought to our attention that the build script might have some
problems on MACOSX 10.4 and Solaris. Please contact us if you have more info
on this.

For MACOSX 10.4, it seems that you have to set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
environment variable to 10.4 before running make. Apparently it defaults to
10.1.

* Development 
ldns is developed on Linux and FreeBSD.

REQUIREMENTS
- OpenSSL
- (GNU) libtool (that's glibtool, not libtool in OSX)
- GNU make

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-<VERSION>
5. ./configure
6. gmake (it needs gnu make to compile, on systems where GNU make is the
   default you can just use 'make')
7. sudo gmake install
(8. gmake examples [make example programs included])
(9. gmake drill && sudo gmake drill-install to build and install drill)

* Examples
There are some examples in the examples/ directory. These can be built with:
1. cd examples/
2. autoreconf [--with-ldns=../]
3. gmake

The library has to be installed in order for this to work. If it is not
installed in one of the default paths (i.e. if you have specified --prefix
when configuring the library) you can use --with-ldns=PATH to specify that
path. PATH in that case would be '../'

In that last case, you will also need to have your LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to
the .libs directory to be able to run the examples. I.e.:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib ./ldns-version

* Drill

Drill can be build by issueing a 'make drill' from the ldns source dir.

If you want to build drill by hand, the configure and running options are
the same as those for the examples. 


* Building from repository

If you are building from the repository you will need to have (gnu)
autotools like libtool and autoreconf installed. A list of all the commands
needed to build everything can be found in README.svn. Note that the actual
commands may be a little bit different on your machine. Most important are
libtoolize and make allautoconf (or do autoreconf manually in the subdirs)


* Developers
ldns is developed by the ldns team at NLnet Labs. This team currently
consists out of:
  o Jelte Jansen
  o Miek Gieben

* Credits
We have received patches from the following people, thanks!
  o Erik Rozendaal
  o HÃ¥kan Olsson

KNOWN ISSUES

It has been brought to our attention that the build script might have some
problems on MACOSX 10.4 and Solaris. Please contact us if you have more info
on this. 

For MACOSX 10.4, it seems that you have to set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
environment variable to 10.4 before running make. Apparently it defaults to
10.1.

Also RedHat 9 seems to be having a problem when building ldns - we have
very little details about this.

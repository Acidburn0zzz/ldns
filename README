Some general readme information would be nice. Most up to date is 
website: www.nlnetlabs.nl/ldns/

On that page you can also subscribe to the ldns mailing list.

* Development
ldns is developed on Linux and FreeBSD.

REQUIREMENTS
- OpenSSL
- (GNU) libtool (that's glibtool, not libtool in OSX)
- GNU make

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-<VERSION>
3. libtoolize
4. autoreconf
5. ./configure
6. gmake (it needs gnu make to compile)
(7. gmake progs [make example programs included])

* Examples
There are some examples in the examples/ directory. These can be built with:
1. autoreconf
2. ./configure
3. gmake

The library has to be installed in order for this to work. If it is not
installed in one of the default paths you should add the following arguments to
the configure command:
LDFLAGS="-L<path_to_library_dir>" CPPFLAGS="-I<path_to_header_dir>"

If you have only built the library and not installed it anywhere, these
values should be:
LDFLAGS="-L<build-dir>/.libs" CPPFLAGS="-I<build-dir> -I<src_dir>"

In that last case, you will also need to have your LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to
the .libs directory to be able to run the examples.


* Drill

Drill is automatically built alongside with the main library. If you want to
build drill by hand, the configure and running options are the same as those
for the examples. You can use the make target 'lib' if you only want to
build the library and not drill (and make install-lib to install it).

* Developers
ldns is developed by the ldns team at NLnet Labs. This team currently
consists out of:
  o Jelte Jansen
  o Erik Rozendaal
  o Miek Gieben

* Credits
We have received patches from the following people, thanks!
  o HÃ¥kan Olsson

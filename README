* Development 
ldns is developed on Linux and FreeBSD.

REQUIREMENTS
- OpenSSL
- (GNU) libtool (that's glibtool, not libtool in OSX)
- GNU make

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-<VERSION>
5. ./configure
6. gmake (it needs gnu make to compile, on systems where GNU make is the
   default you can just use 'make')
7. sudo gmake install
(8. gmake examples [make example programs included])
(9. gmake drill && sudo gmake drill-install to build and install drill)

* Examples
There are some examples in the examples/ directory. These can be built with:
1. cd examples/
2  autoreconf
3. ./configure [--with-ldns=../]
4. gmake

* Drill
Drill can be build with:
1. cd drill/
2. autoreconf
3. ./configure [--with-ldns=../]
4. gmake

Note, if built with --with-ldns=../ you will need to set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to let library loader find the library.

* Building from repository

If you are building from the repository you will need to have (gnu)
autotools like libtool and autoreconf installed. A list of all the commands
needed to build everything can be found in README.svn. Note that the actual
commands may be a little bit different on your machine.

* Developers
ldns is developed by the ldns team at NLnet Labs. This team currently
consists out of:
  o Jelte Jansen
  o Miek Gieben

* Credits
We have received patches from the following people, thanks!
  o Erik Rozendaal
  o HÃ¥kan Olsson
  o Jakob Schlyter
  o Paul Wouters


KNOWN ISSUES

It has been brought to our attention that the build script might have some
problems on MACOSX 10.4 and Solaris. Please contact us if you have more info
on this. 

For MACOSX 10.4, it seems that you have to set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
environment variable to 10.4 before running make. Apparently it defaults to
10.1.

Also RedHat 9 seems to be having a problem when building ldns - we have
very little details about this.

ldns - snapshot releases

These release are a snapshot of the ongoing development of ldns. Each
snapshot release has a specific date tight to it.

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-snap-<DATE>
3. ./configure
4. gmake (it needs gnu make to compile)

After this some test executables are created; run-test[1-8]. These
are used in development, but can also be used as a basis for development.

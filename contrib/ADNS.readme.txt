Attached please find the source for ADNS - my functionality port of LDNS to the .NET platform.  AS .NET does not have a native BIGNUM type, I used Mihnea RÄƒdulescu's BigInteger Library (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/BigInteger_Library.aspx) from CodeProject to help with key manipulation.  BigInteger Library is released under the Code Project Open License (http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx) which seems, to my reading, to be compatible with the BSD license.  I would like to release ADNS under the BSD license to make it compatible with the rest of the LDNS project.  

I have included the Visual Studio .NET 2008 solutions file so that anyone who wants to build the library from that can, although it isn't strictly necessary to build it that way.  

Until documentation is completed, please direct all inquiries/etc to anicoll@cert.org.

Current TODO list

Post 1.0 Stuff:
---------------
o Dname compression
o A /fast/ impl. for holding a zone (and retrieving data from it)
o refactor ldns_verify_rrsig_keylist and
  ldns_verify_rrsig (fold in TSIG stuff or leave it out?)
o Different digest for DS (spec currently specifies SHA-1)
o Make it possible to build with OpenSSL

What actually doesn't work:
---------------------------
o [doc]  const function are correct i think, but const values in struct not
o manual page for signzone

Implementation:
---------------
o really think one last time about the double pointers
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o use size_t where needed

To be removed:
-------------
LDNS_STATUS_CHECK_GOTO
Debugging code

Current TODO list

What actually doesn't work:
---------------------------
o [dnssec] NSEC conversion frm str to host
o [dnssec] Different digests for DS
 - need a digest type?
o [dnssec] NSEC generation??
o [openssl] openssl's setup function (esp. random)
o [openssl] -lssl in library creation and autoconf - somewhat fix in 0.60/0.65
o [doc]  const function are correct i think, but const values in struct not

Implementation:
---------------
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o use size_t where needed
o DNSSEC
	- do we call random()? Need an optional ldns_setup() which does
	  this
o init function? random - load_ssl_errors()
	- SSL_load_error_str()? 
o SERVER stuff; open connection and such - NOT DONE AT ALL - will happen in .90
o const args for all functions

To ponder and discuss:
----------------------
o private key type? This works, but not (yet) for tsig stuff
	ldns_algorithm used for verfication
	ldns_sign_algorithm used for signing - including
				shared secret signing
	work in progress - works for RSA/DSA. I want to 
	fold in the tsig stuff as well
o install mx, keygen, chaos somewhere, along with manpages??
o All lookup table stuff in _table types?

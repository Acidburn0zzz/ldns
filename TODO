---------------
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o network code
	- tcp
	- axfr
	- tsig?
	- timeouts part of resolver struct with access functions and
	  sane default values
o DNSSEC
o Make a shared library and test compile some programs

Documentation:
--------------
o Crypto interface for dnssec
o Doxygen
o Manpages
o Introduction
o Tuturial
o Webpage
o Mailing list(s)

To ponder and discuss:
----------------------
o char * <=> uint8_t * (partly done? Erik?)
o Second layer (higher level convenience functions)? (Later)
  o Higherlevel functions, like search for this RR with this name in
    these RRlists. Give me all RR's of this zone with this type. etc.
o Dependency on openSSL?

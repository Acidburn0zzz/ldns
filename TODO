Current TODO list

o check todo list :p

What actually doesn't work:
---------------------------
o [dnssec] NSEC conversion frm str to host
o [dnssec] Different digests for DS
 - need a digest type?
o [dnssec] NSEC generation??
o [doc]  const function are correct i think, but const values in struct not
o Error handling needs to be improved
o manual page for signzone

Implementation:
---------------
o really think one last time about the double pointers
o str2host on string rdata types needs escapes and surrounding quotes
  support
o check all conversion routines on missing types
	- wire2host
	- host2wire
	- str2host
	- host2str
o use size_t where needed
o SERVER stuff; there is support for the lua stuff [experimental]
o const args for all functions?

To ponder and discuss:
----------------------
o private key type? This works, but not (yet) for tsig stuff
	ldns_algorithm used for verfication
	ldns_sign_algorithm used for signing - including
				shared secret signing
	work in progress - works for RSA/DSA. I want to 
	fold in the tsig stuff as well
o install mx, keygen, chaos somewhere, along with manpages??
o All lookup table stuff in _table types?

To be removed:
-------------
LDNS_STATUS_CHECK_GOTO
Debugging code

Structure and function of ldns_rr

API
   From Net::DNS::RR - DNS Resource Record class

   ldns_rr is the base structure for DNS Recorce Records.
   [ See also the manual pages for each RR type. - TODO??]
 

  ldns_rr *ldns_rr_new(void)
    Returns a pointer to a newly created ldns_rr structure.
    
  [TODO: do we want the stuff descibed below?]
  ldns_rr_new (from string)
     $a     = Net::DNS::RR->new("foo.example.com. 86400 A 10.1.2.3");
     $mx    = Net::DNS::RR->new("example.com. 7200 MX 10 mailhost.example.com.");
     $cname = Net::DNS::RR->new("www.example.com 300 IN CNAME www1.example.com");
     $txt   = Net::DNS::RR->new("baz.example.com 3600 HS TXT 'text record'");

    Returns a "Net::DNS::RR" object of the appropriate type and initialized
    from the string passed by the user. The format of the string is that
    used in zone files, and is compatible with the string returned by
    "Net::DNS::RR->string".

    The name and RR type are required; all other information is optional. If
    omitted, the TTL defaults to 0 and the RR class defaults to IN. Omitting
    the optional fields is useful for creating the empty RDATA sections
    required for certain dynamic update operations. See the
    "Net::DNS::Update" manual page for additional examples.

    All names must be fully qualified. The trailing dot (.) is optional.

  void ldns_rr_print(ldns_rr *r)
    Prints the record to the standard output. 

  ldns_buffer *ldns_rr_string(ldns_rr *r)
    Returns a ldns_buffer with the string representation of the RR. Calls the rdatastr method to
    get the RR-specific data.

  ldns_buffer ldns_rr_rdatastr(ldns_rr *r)
    Returns a pointer to a ldns_buffer containing with string containing
    RR-specific data. 

  ldns_rdf *ldns_rr_name(ldns_rr *r)
    Returns the record's domain name as a ldns_rdf type. [XXX how should we
    return stuff like this? ldns_rdf, uint8_t, ldns_buffer?

  ldns_rdf_type ldns_rr_get_type(ldns_rr *r)
    Returns the record's type.

  ldns_rr_class ldns_rr_get_class(ldns_rr *r)
    Returns the record's class.

  uint32_t ldns_rr_get_ttl(ldns_rr *r)
    Returns the record's time-to-live (TTL).

  [TODO nodig??] rdlength
        $rdlength = $rr->rdlength;

    Returns the length of the record's data section.

  [TODO nodig??] rdata
        $rdata = $rr->rdata

    Returns the record's data section as binary data.

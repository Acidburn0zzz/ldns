           : 1.0.1: ldns-team
	* added include/ and lib/ dirs so that you can compile against ldns
	  without installing ldns on your system

	Drill:
	* -r was killed in favor of -o <header bit mnemonic> which 
	  allows for a header bits setting (and maybe more in the
	  future)

	* License change: ldns is now BSD licensed
	* ldns now depends on SSL
	* Networking code cleanup, added (some) server udp/tcp support

	and Paul Wouters)

25 Jan 2006: 1.1.0: ldns-team
	* Added include/ and lib/ dirs so that you can compile against ldns
	  without installing ldns on your system
	* Makefile updates
	* Starting usage of assert throughout the library to catch illegal calls
	* Solaris 9 testing was carried out. Ldns now compiles on that
	  platform; some gnuism were identified and fixed.
	* The ldns_zone structure was stress tested. The current setup
	 (ie. just a list of rrs) can scale to zone file in order of
	 megabytes. Sorting such zone is still difficult.
	* Reading multiline b64 encoded rdata works.
	* OpenSSL was made optional, configure --without-ssl.
	  Ofcourse all dnssec/tsig related functions are disabled

	Drill:
	* -r was killed in favor of -o <header bit mnemonic> which 
	  allows for a header bits setting (and maybe more in the
	  future)
	* DS was added to the list of records which, when used automaticly
	  enable DNSSEC (i.e. Set the do-bit in the query)
	* Implement a crude RTT check, it now distinguishes between
	  reacheable and unreacheable.
	
	Examples:
	* ldns-dpa was added to the examples - this is the Dns Packet
	  Analyzer tool.
	
	Code:
	* All networking code was moved to net.c
	* rdata.c: added asserts to the rdf set/get functions

	API:
	Changed:
	* ldns_rr_new_frm_str() is extented with an extra variable which
	  in common use may be NULL. This trickles through to:
          o ldns_rr_new_frm_fp
	  o ldns_rr_new_frm_fp_l
	  Which also get an extra variable
	* tsig.h: made internal used functions static:
	  ldns_digest_name and ldns_tsig_mac_new

	New:
	* ldns_zone_sort: Sort a zone
	* ldns_bgsend(): background send, returns a socket.


18 Oct 2005: 1.0.0: ldns-team
	* Commited a patch from Håkan Olsson
	* Added UPDATE support (Jakob Schlyter and Håkan Olsson)
	* License change: ldns is now BSD licensed
	* ldns now depends on SSL
	* Networking code cleanup, added (some) server udp/tcp support
	* A zone type is introduced. Currently this is a list
	  of RRs, so it will not scale well.
	* [beta] Zonefile parsing was added
	* [tools] Drill was added to ldns - see drill/
	* [tools] experimental signer was added
	* [building] better check for ssl
	* [building] major revision of build system
	* [building] added rpm .spec in packaging/ (thanks to Paul Wouters)
	* [building] A lot of cleanup in the build scripts (thanks to Jakob Schlyter
	and Paul Wouters)

28 Jul 2005: 0.70: ldns-team
	* [func] ldns_pkt_get_section now returns copies from the rrlists
	  in the packet. This can be freed by the user program
	* [code] added ldns_ prefixes to function from util.h
	* [inst] removed documentation from default make install
	* Usual fixes in documentation and code

20 Jun 2005: 0.66: ldns-team
	Rel. Focus: drill-pre2 uses some functions which are
	not in 0.65
	* dnssec_cd bit function was added
	* Zone infrastructure was added
	* Usual fixes in documentation and code

13 Jun 2005: 0.65: ldns-team
	* Repository is online at: 
	  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/ldns/svn/
	* Apply reference copying throuhgout ldns, except in 2 
	  places in the ldns_resolver structure (._domain and
	 ._nameservers)
	* Usual array of bugfixes
	* Documentation added
	* keygen.c added as an example for DNSSEC programming

23 May 2005: 0.60: ldns-team
	* Removed config.h from the header installed files
	  (you're not supposed to include that in a libary)
	* Further tweaking
	  - DNSSEC signing/verification works
	  - Assorted bug fixes and tweaks (memory management) 

May 2005: 0.50: ldns-team
	* First usable release
	* Basic DNS functionality works
	* DNSSEC validation works

This short document is intended to shed some light on
the philosophy behind ldns.

Closely match the api/interface of Perl's Net::DNS; make it easy to 
toss around RR sets, DNS packets, Resolvers, etc. etc.

* Everything by is called by reference. If data in the structures must
  be copied an optional _clone() function is provided.
  This is mirrored in the free() functions, a ldns_*_free() frees the
  structures' pointer. A ldns_*_deep_free() looks into a structure
  an frees everything.

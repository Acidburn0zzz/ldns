QUICK INSTALL GUIDE

drill is a subdirectory in ldns.

To compile drill you need:
autoreconf && ./configure --with-ldns=../ && make

when ldns isn't installed on the system, or:

autoreconf && ./configure --with-ldns && make

when ldns is installed. Also see ./configure --help

In the first case you must run drill as:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../.libs ./drill <options>

* Development

ldns development is ongoing. Most of the functionality is there, but some
DNSSEC pieces are missing.

Feedback is appriciated.

* Compilation

When getting this source as snapshot you need to compile it first.
For compilation you need gmake and the gnu autotools.

Extract the source and in the source directory:
libtoolize && autoreconf && ./configure && gmake
(or use ./setup)

(or just make on Linux)
